## Introduction 

Wave is a Python library for the processing of waveform accelerometery data. Wave provides an efficient and user-friendly way of processing data without the requirements of dedicated computer clusters. The library currently accepts accelerometry data from binary AX3 or GENEActiv files to give intensity and/or orientation of monitor statistics at specified time resolution(s). This is designed to be a more user-friendly version of [pampro](https://github.com/MRC-Epid/pampro).

## Getting Started

Please ensure you meet the system requirements before continuing, these can be found on the [Requirements](Requirements) page. After you have checked your computer specifications against the system requirements, the quickest way of getting started with Wave is by downloading the latest executable on the [release](https://github.com/Cobine/Wave/releases) page. Several example files have been provided and can either be directly downloaded [here](https://github.com/Cobine/Wave/tree/main/Example_Files) or for further explanation of these files check the [Example Files](Examples) page. Please read the [Setup](Setup) and [User Guide](User-Guide) pages for guidance on installation, using the software, and processing files.
